AutoDevOps AI Agent Crew
------------------------
This script launches a multi-agent "hybrid" crew to automate the Pull Request (PR)
code review, testing, and reporting process. It integrates with GitHub for
reading files and posting the final summary.

This version uses the 'gemini-2.5-flash' model for all agents to ensure
compatibility with free-tier API rate limits.
